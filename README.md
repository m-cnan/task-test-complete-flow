# Portfolio Website

## Summary
This is a simple and modern portfolio website designed to showcase projects. It features a responsive layout with a dark mode toggle functionality to enhance user experience. The website is built with HTML and CSS, and is designed to be lightweight and easy to navigate.

## Setup
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-website.git
   cd portfolio-website
   ```

2. **Open the HTML file:**
   Open `index.html` in your web browser. You can simply double-click the file or use any web server to serve the content.

## Usage
Once the website is open in your browser, you will see a header with the title "My Portfolio" and a button to toggle dark mode. Below the header, there are project cards displaying the names and descriptions of three sample projects.

- **Toggle Dark Mode:** Click on the "Toggle Dark Mode" button to switch between light and dark themes.

Feel free to replace the project descriptions with your actual projects and customize the styles as needed.

## Code Explanation
The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components:

- **HTML Structure:** The webpage contains a header with a title and a button. Below it, there is a section for displaying project cards.
  
- **Styling:** CSS is used for layout and design, ensuring the body transitions smoothly between light and dark modes. The project cards feature hover effects that make them scale slightly for an interactive feel.

- **Dark Mode Toggle:** JavaScript is used to handle the dark mode toggle functionality. When the button is clicked, it switches the classes of the body element to alternate between the 'light' and 'dark' themes.

- **Validation Checks:** The code includes console assertions to ensure that essential elements are present and correctly configured.
